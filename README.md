# VF-1
Command line gopher client.  High speed, low drag.

## Installation

Ideally, you would install VF-1 as follows:

```
pip3 install VF-1
```

This should install the command `vf1` in either `/usr/local/bin`,
`/usr/bin`, or `~/.local/bin`.

Alternatively, check out the source code and install it as follows:

```
pip3 install .
```

If you're a developer, you probably want an "editable" installation:

```
pip3 install --editable .
```

If you're a developer on a Windows machine and your pip is broken, you
can also install as follows:

```
python3 setup.py install
```

And finally, if you just can't install it, just run the `vf1.py`
file directly.

```
python3 vf1.py
```
